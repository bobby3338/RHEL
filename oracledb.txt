-- RHEL 8 Configuration changes required on T74L1387D03 to install Oracle 19c
--

1. Create group oinstall 
	
2. Create user oracle with oinstall as primary group and C shell as it's default shell
		
3. Change permissions on /opt/app to 755

4. Change owner:group of /opt/app/voled and it's subdirectories to oracle:oinstall
	
5. Set umask to 022 in /export/home/oracle.cshrc for the duration of the install*
	
6. Remove noexec, in etc/fstab for /dev/mapper/VG00-TMP for the duration of the install*
		
	***NOTE: requires remount for change to take effect. Check mount -l if installer won't execute.

7. Enable X11 forwarding for the duration of the install*
	make sure X11Forwarding yes is in file /etc/ssh/sshd_config and is not commented out

8. Prevent session timeout for the duration of the install and disable TMUX*

9. Open port 1521 in the firewall

10. Enable the cron service 

11. Disable fapolicyd. This service must be disabled for xterm to run in RHEL 8. The installer will not run if fapolicyd is enabled.

12. Add "session required pam_limits.so" to /etc/pam.d/login

13. Set DISPLAY to 10     # export DISPLAY=:10

	> echo $DISPLAY should display 10 or 10.0
	
14. Install packages required for Oracle 19c.

	To install required packages:

	> yum install -y install oracle_database-preinstall-19c
	
15. Verify kernel parameters.

	-- The file /etc/sysctl.d/97-oracle-database-sysctl.conf should be created by the previous step.
	   If not, manually create it.
	-- The following settings should be in /etc/sysctl.d/97-oracle-database-sysctl.conf

	kernel.sem = 250 32000 100 128
	kernel.shmmni = 4096
	kernel.shmmax = 37580963840  (must be half of total RAM)
	kernel.shmall = 37580963840  (must be half of total RAM)
	fs.file-max = 6815744
	fs.aio-max-nr = 1048576
	net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 9000 65500
	#net.ipv6.ip_local_port_range="9000 65500"
	net.core.rmem_default = 262144
	net.core.rmem_max = 4194304
	net.core.wmem_default = 262144
	net.core.wmem_max = 1048586
	vm.nr_hugepages = 2050
	

*These parameters must be reset to their original values after the install because they are STIG violations

5. Set umask to 022 in /export/home/oracle/.cshrc for the duration of the install*
	NOTE: setting was modified for /home. /export/home will not exist in RHEL
 
 
6. Remove noexec, in etc/fstab for /dev/mapper/VG00-TMP for the duration of the install*
7. Enable X11 forwarding for the duration of the install*
8. Prevent session timeout for the duration of the install and disable TMUX*
	NOTE: reminder to request #5,6,7,8 be reverted post install
 
 
12. Add "session required pam_limits.so" to /etc/pam.d/login
	NOTE: this is already satisfied and called in login:
	/etc/pam.d/login includes the following line:
	session    include      system-auth
	And the requested pam entry is in system-auth:
	[root@home]# grep pam_limits.so /etc/pam.d/system-auth
	session     required    pam_limits.so
 
 
14. Install packages required for Oracle 19c.
> yum install -y install oracle_database-preinstall-19c
	NOTE: I cannot find this installation package. It is not available from redhat repos that we have enabled.
 
 
11. Disable fapolicyd. This service must be disabled for xterm to run in RHEL 8. The installer will not run if fapolicyd is enabled.
	NOTE: fapolicyd is enforced by DISA STIG. I did not disable it. We here at dc2hs run oracle installers for our DB team after whitelisting the application in the fapolicyd rules. I have added rules/whitelists that should work. However, if there are 'operation not permitted' errors, please let me know the commands you are running and as what user. I can in turn run these through the fapolicyd debug and add any additional whitelists that are necessary. Once we have a satisfactory configuration outlined, it can be mass configured on any future node.
